# dss-jupyterhub-notebooks

Please explore the various libraries of Jupyter Notebooks produced by ECMWF in the context of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS).

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that these notebooks are stored in a read-only directory, and should you wish to save any changes you will have to do so in your personal space.

## dss-notebooks

The dss-notebooks directory contains technical notebooks related to the data available via the Data Store Services (DSS). This library includes two sub-directories:

### datasets

Notebooks which demonstrate how to work with the datasets. The folders are named after the slug for the datasets available in the DSS, and include basic examples such as how to create the overview images used on the catalogue entries.

### documentation

Notebooks which document, with example code, several aspects of the data processing that occurs in the backend of the DSS. For example the grib to netCDF conversion and the the calculation of daily statistics.


## c3s-training

The C3S training material is also published as a [JupyterBook](https://ecmwf-training.github.io/c3s-training/intro.html). Here we provide direct access to the notebooks so that they can be executed directly. The training material is organised in sub-modules which group the examples into data themes, the sub-modules included are:

1. **climate-indices** - Climate indicators and indexes
1. **projections** - Climate projections (CMIP and CORDEX)
2. **reanalysis** - The ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA) family
3. **sat-obs-atmos-comp** - Satelliite observations of atmospheric composition
4. **sat-obs-atmos-physics** - Satelliite observations of atmospheric physics
5. **sat-obs-hydro-cryo** - Satelliite observations of hydrology and cryosphere
6. **sat-obs-land** - Satelliite observations of land
7. **sat-obs-ocean** - Satelliite observations of ocean
8. **seasonal-forecast** - The ECMWF Seasonal Forecast family



## copernicus-training-cams

The CAMS training material is also published as a [JupyterBook](https://ecmwf-projects.github.io/copernicus-training-cams). Here we provide direct access to the notebooks so that they can be executed directly.


## sketchbook-earth

The [Sketchbook Earth](https://ecmwfcode4earth.github.io/sketchbook-earth/intro.html) provides a series of Jupyter books which document the metrics calculated for the [Climate Intelligence Reports](https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-intelligence) produced by C3S.
